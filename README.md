Resume Ranking System using LLMs ðŸ’¼ðŸ¤–
1. Aim
The primary aim of this project is to develop an automated system that ranks resumes based on job descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs). The system helps recruiters efficiently screen candidates by automating resume analysis, thereby reducing manual effort, increasing accuracy, and minimizing biases in the recruitment process.
2. Introduction
The recruitment process often involves handling a large number of resumes, making manual screening time-consuming and error-prone. This project introduces a solution to automate resume ranking using LLMs. By analyzing resumes and comparing them with job descriptions, the system can quickly rank candidates, providing recruiters with a more efficient way to manage applications and make data-driven decisions.

4. Motivation and Challenges
Motivation:
Recruitment often involves sifting through hundreds or even thousands of resumes. This manual process is slow, prone to biases, and can result in missing qualified candidates. Automating resume ranking with LLMs solves this problem by making the process faster, more objective, and more scalable.
Challenges:
ï‚·Integrating LLMs for accurate resume analysis.
ï‚·Ensuring scalability to handle large volumes of resumes and job descriptions.
ï‚·Managing data privacy and security when dealing with sensitive personal information.
5. Objectives and Scope of the Project
Objectives:
ï‚·Automate the ranking of resumes by comparing them with job descriptions.
ï‚·Provide recruiters with a ranked list of candidates based on relevance.
ï‚·Offer personalized recommendations for users on skills and courses to improve their resumes.
Scope:
This project targets mid-to-large-scale organizations that handle large volumes of job applications. The system is designed to be scalable, adaptable to various industries, and user-friendly for both recruiters and applicants.
6. Proposed Methodology (System Architecture and Module Details)
System Architecture:
ï‚·Frontend: A user-friendly web interface where users upload resumes and recruiters manage job vacancies.
ï‚·Backend: Django-based server handling user requests, job postings, and integrating with LLMs for resume analysis.
ï‚·LLM API: Used to extract key information from resumes and match them with job descriptions.
Modules:
ï‚·User Registration & Login: Handles authentication for recruiters and job applicants.
ï‚·Job Vacancy Creation: Allows recruiters to create job posts and receive resumes.
ï‚·Resume Upload & Analysis: Applicants upload resumes, which are analyzed using LLMs.
